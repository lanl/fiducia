Utilities for processing raw DANTE data. Typical steps include:
    - attenuator correction
    - background shot subtraction
    - channel alignment (via e.g. peak finding)
    - temporal axis calibration

def bkgCorrect(df, timesFrame):
    r"""
    Give a Dante data frame containing measurement data and background
    shot data, remove the background from the data and return the corrected
    data as a dataframe. Note that the returned dataframe is different
    in a few ways from the input dataframe. First, the returned dataframe
    is assumed to have strings as column headers, whereas the returned
    dataframe will have integers (corresponding to dante channel
    number) as the column headers. In addition, the input dataframe
    will start indexing at some number above 0 (usually 18, due to the
    header length), whereas the returned dataframe is re-indexed to
    begin at 0.
    
    A dataframe with corresponding time scales to df is also passed to this
    function for reindexing from strings to integers. This also acts as a
    placeholder in case it is necessary to interpolate values if the
    background shot and measurement shot timescales are not the same. Though
    this type of interpolation is not currently implemented.
    
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    df: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
        Dataframe of raw dante data. This should contain both the shot
        measurement and the shot background as columns. See readDanteData().
        The columns in this dataframe are assumed to be strings.
        
    timesFrame: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
        Dataframe containing time axis corresponding to dante signals in
        df dataframe. See timesScope().
    
    Returns
    -------
    timesBkg: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
        Returns a dataframe of times corresponding to dfCorrected signals.
        The columns in this dataframe are integers corresponding to Dante
        channel number.
    
    dfCorrected: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
        Returns a dataframe of background subtracted dante signals. The
        columns in this dataframe are integers corresponding to Dante
        channel number.

        Lower and upper bound edges of the signal containing region for
        each dante channel. The lower bound is in 0 index and the upper

    Given a dante data file, an attenuators file, and an offsets file, reads
